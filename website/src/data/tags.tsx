/*
 * ADD YOUR SITE TO THE DOCUSAURUS SHOWCASE:
 *
 * Requirements for adding your site to our showcase:
 * - It is a production-ready site with real content and decent customizations
 * (different from the init templates)
 * - It is NOT a work-in-progress with empty pages
 * - It has a stable domain (a Netlify/Vercel deploy preview is not allowed)
 *
 * Instructions:
 * - Add your site in the json array below
 * - `title` is your project's name (no need for the "Docs" suffix)
 * - A short (‚â§120 characters) description of your project
 * - Use relevant tags to categorize your site (read the tag descriptions below)
 * - Add a local image preview (decent screenshot of your Docusaurus site)
 * - The image MUST be added to the GitHub repository, and use `require("img")`
 * - The image has to have minimum width 640 and an aspect of no wider than 2:1
 * - If your website is open-source, add your source link. The link should open
 *   to a directory containing the `docusaurus.config.js` file
 * - Open a PR and check for reported CI errors
 *
 * Example PR: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/3976
 *
 * If you edit this file through the GitHub interface, you can:
 * - Submit first your users.tsx edit PR
 * - This will create a branch on your Docusaurus fork (usually "patch-1")
 * - Go to https://github.com/<username>/docusaurus/tree/<branch>/website/src/data/showcase
 * - Drag-and-drop an image here to add it to your existing PR
 *
 * Please help us maintain this showcase page data:
 * - Update sites with wrong data
 * - Ensure site tags remain correct over time
 * - Remove sites not using Docusaurus anymore
 * - Add missing Docusaurus sites (if the site owner agreed)
